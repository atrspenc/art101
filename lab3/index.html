			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab was about creating and organizing files/folders. In addition, it was an exercise for adding links and creating the index.html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the major problems that arose for me was figuring out how to link my labs through my homepage. I was doing it correctly, yet I was not getting results. My partner told me that it takes time for the commands from my local device to appear in the server then back to me. So what I had to do was take a deep breath and just come back in a few minutes.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment, while simple, frustrated me. It taught me to have patience and that sometimes I have to think back to the little things said in class and my notes. But overall, I am learning as I go and gaining more confidence.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I now have links on my homepage and I am learning how to edit everything slightly more corretly.</p>
