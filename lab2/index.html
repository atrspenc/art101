					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Lab 2 was about changing the look and content of the page while using CSS. We also are adding a link from our home page to the lab</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the first problems we encountered was trying to figure out exactly where to put "Hello World". The next problem that we ran into was actully working in and figuring out how the CSS file worked. We did trial and error which line was correct for the "Hello World". We also bounced ideas off each other and even asked for external help. Good job team :D </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Rhianne and I honestly put in a lot of effort because we took our time and played around with the attributes. It was honestly scary and a little frustrating at times. But in the end it all worked out.  </p>
