					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use libraries and jQuery to code a button onto my webpage.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the main problems I had with this lab was how long it took for my local machine to communicate with the receiver. I had an error that one of my classmates helped me fix during sections. However, me and my classmates had trouble with the code but then went to the discord and fixed it together.</p>
