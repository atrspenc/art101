// Create a new function in your file, call it what you like, but choose wisely.
// In the function, declare a variable userName and use window.prompt() to get the user's name from the user. Here's some helpLinks to an external site..
// Sort the letters of the user's name and return those from the function. Hint: You can't sort strings, but you can sort arrays. Can you convert it back and forth?
// Make sure your function uses return to return the results.
// Outside of the function, call the function and output the results with document.writeln() to neatly output the user's sorted name.
// Strings print nicely on your webpage, so you don't have to use JSON.stringify() this time.
